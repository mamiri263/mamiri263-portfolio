## You shouldn't buy a gaming laptop and here's why

First of all gaming laptops are just terrible things to invest on and have so many different cons like:

- Extrmely short life-span.
- Being buggy and causing issues later on.
- Too expensive for absolutely no reason.

### My experience in gaming laptops
My first ever computer was a gaming laptop i got in 2017 as a birthday present. and oh boy it really did preform well for it's time and it just did what it needed to do. after about a year or two, i notcied to feel as if it was extremely slower than before, that was when i realized the gpu(graphics card) had completely failed and had various software issues for no reason. recently I had been fed up and decided to factory reset it and I did exactly that.
After hours of waiting it finally finished and guess what, Windows had completely failed and my only open door was linux so I installed ubuntu and gave it a try. After a ton of errors and issues with hardware and software i finally fixed everything. If only i had bought an actual pc i wouldn't have had to go thought all of these issues.

so todays lesson is:

# DO NOT BUY A GAMING LAPTOP

## alternatives
- You can build your own custom pc It's way more cheaper and It'll last you way longer.
- If you just want to just do gaming i would suggest just going with a console.
