## This is my first blog post! everything has a start right? *right*?

The universe had a start too like the big bang theory, religions and etc...
But what really amazes me every single time is the fact that all of the universe was created from something small or big perhaps who knows.

### Anyways here's some stuff that i find interesting:
* CATS
Cats are the best ever creatures invented and I would love to have one.
* Listening to music(not playing it i'm terrible at that)
* noodles.
