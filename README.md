# This website is made for me to preview all my projects in the future and it has some stuff about me too!

- the domain hosting i used is cloudflare and my web hosting is firebase.
- gatsby.js was used to make this website.
- this project is open source so you can use any code that i have used in this project.

note: i accidentally used my other github account(darkenmo) to push to this website that's why it says that some commits were from another contributer
